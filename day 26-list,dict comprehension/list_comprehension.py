#list comprehension shortens the code where we use for loop

numbers = [1,2,3]
# if you wnat to add +1 to each element and add it to a new list, you can create an empty list, loop thrugh the numbers, add 1 to ech number and append it to the new list
#e.g.

new_numbers = []

for n in numbers:
    new_number = n +1
    new_numbers.append(new_number)

# this can be shortened with a shortcut
#e.g. new_numbers = [new_item for item in list if test]
#new_item is the change you want to make to the item in the list
#test is if you want to add any condition

new_list = [n+1 for n in numbers]
new_conditional_list = [num + 1 for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
